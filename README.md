The DesignShare Application built for the 1303 Mobile Device Deployment class.


This app uses PHP and MySQL, as well as the CodeIgniter Framework. SQL Dumps will be located in a
'sql_database' directory. Please install the database prior to using the app, in order to use
application and its features.




-------///  UPDATE 03-15-12  ///-----------

The DesignShare app will no longer feature upload functionality as originally intended.
Instead, the platform will display art from the Dribbble API, allow for app users to makes lists
of their favorite designs, and to comment on these designs.
