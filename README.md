DesignShare Mobile Website
===========

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The DesignShare mobile website is a tool for designers to share concepts and inspiration with other designers. It was designed and built as a project for the completion of my Bachelor's Degree program, and uses several popular web technologies. In addition, DesignShare is relient on access to a public API to gather artwork and designer information from the internet. The online application allows users to view artwork and design concepts from other users, to view designers' other work and websites, and to collect and curate sets of artwork that they find interesting. Comments can be added by individual users to provide an interactive experience for other DesignShare users, and to foster the communication between designers that allows for their growth as artists.</p>

<h2>Code & Technologies</h2>

<p>DesignShare is a PHP-driven web site, that utilizes a responsive design to provide easy access to mobile users. It relies on a combination of <strong>PHP5</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> to execute back-end functionality, such as user logins, commenting, and storing lists of favorite designs. EllisLab, Inc.'s <strong>CodeIgniter</strong> framework was included in the build to ensure the project's timely completion, and was instrumental in shortening the time spent in development. <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and the <strong>jQuery Mobile ThemeBuilder</strong> were used to simplify the normal <strong>CSS</strong> styling, and factored in heavily to the development of several pages on the site.</p>

<p>Additionally, the site draws data from <strong>Dribbble.com's public API</strong>, and returns results for individual artwork and artists in the form of <strong>JSON</strong> objects. These objects require decoding and manipulation at several points during the use of the site, and are manipulated through the use of PHP.</p>

<h2>Access Instructions</h2>

<p>Because several site features require a profile to track a user's activity and favorites, access to the site is dependent on the creation and use of a new user profile. Feel free to create a new user profile, and to explore all of the site's features from any device!</p>
